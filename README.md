# pneumonia_influenza_deaths

## Motivation

As we all know the sudden attack of COVID-19 make us so helpless and change our daily lives because we do not have any vaccine at present. I wanted to analyze effect of vaccination on deaths from Pneumonia and Influenza to have some insight to see having higher vaccination rates should have some impact on decreasing of number of fatalities.

## Data Selection

To analyze deaths from Pneumonia and Influenza and effect of vaccination, I utilized;
  1) 10 seasons' vaccine coverage data from CDC.
  2) 10 seasons' deaths from Pneumonia and Influenza data from HealthData.gov.
  3) States population totals data for the period 2010-2019 from census.gov.


## Visualization

Line chart, Bar diagram, Boxplot, ggscatter plot were produced to visualize the trend of number of deaths in different seasons, distribution of vaccination rates, and effect of vaccination.


## Packages Used

Python
R


## Future Goals

It was an interesting project for me and I want to expand this project to predict number of deaths from Pneumonia and Influenza. Also, I want to know some more insights adding more measures and parameter to the current datasets.
